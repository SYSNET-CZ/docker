# The 's3 sync' command reports progress every few seconds with lines like:
# Completed 231.4 KiB/~255.4 KiB (3.8 MiB/s) with ~2 file(s) remaining (calculating...)^M
#
# We don't want to send these lines to logentries.  The final line contains
# only ASCII space characters.  The 'sed' commands strip the progress lines
# and the final blank line from the output leaving only one line for each
# file transfered.
